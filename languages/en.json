  "bio": "Hi! My name is Simone, a junior at Virginia Tech, currently studying abroad at Aix-Marseille Université. I was born in Northern Virginia, but my family is originally from Ghana! <br> <br> I’m studying Psychology and French on a pre-med track, and my time here is a perfect chance to improve my French while experiencing life in France. I also enjoy reading, traveling, and meeting new people, which is why I love teaching English! <br> <br> I know how challenging learning a new language can be, so my lessons are practical, friendly, and adapted to your goals. Whether you’re just starting or looking to improve your fluency, I’d love to help you! <br> <br> Send me a message, and let’s get started!",

She has a way of explaining things that makes even the most complicated grammar seem simple. Thanks to her, I feel much more confident speaking English and using it in my daily life. I highly recommend her sessions to anyone looking to learn English! - Léonie"  ,
